This tool generates duplicates based on two fields for instance

Input layer is land parcel boundary and

Say two fields are:

1. County
2. Last name of a person



After defining these two fields you will be able to find the duplicate
shapes (smaller than county say land parcels) that have two or more common last name in for each county

In a nutshell under this circumstances this tool finds all land parcels that have more than one last name in common for each county.
It will ommit dupplicate last name across county and that is the benefit of the multifactor duplicater finder.

or

It identifies those land parcels that have common key generated by concatenating field 1 and field 2 i.e. County+Last name of a person


This script takes four inputs as below
>>1. Input Feature
>>2. Output Feature
>>3. First Filter Key Field
>>4. Second Filter Key Field
